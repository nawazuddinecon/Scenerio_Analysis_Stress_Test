# Scenerio_Analysis_Stress_Test
The codes and graphs of the repository are part of my ready to communicate work titled "Stress Testing, Severity of Scenarios and Indian Banking Sector: A Bayesian VAR Model Approach". 
I have noticed that imposing NIW prior is bit challenging with the available peckages of R and even Python. 
The Stata takes a lot of time to do the same.
On the other, E-views is quite fast in doing Baysian VAR analysis with NIW prior but here is the cost: GIRFs come without confidence intervals.
Further for the model comparision, directional accuracy and scenerio analysis with NIW prior we need codes.
This repository will help researchers to impose NIW prior (with SOC and Dummy-Initial-Observation).
